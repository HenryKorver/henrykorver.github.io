## The Carpenter and The Coder
The age old addage that the poor carpenter blames his tools holds true even in the modern era. While many developers are stuck complaining about why X language lacks Y features, few are actually up to date on the language. If you asked them about one new feature introduced in their favorite version of their favorite language, they might not even know. 

The carpenter metaphor goes a bit further as well. You might assume that the ancient master carpenter would have much lower productivity than the modern one. How could they not? After all the modern craftsman with all their mighty inventions; rotating saw, electric powered drill, and chemical treatments, has access to tools that could complete a project before our erstwhile artisan has even stripped a log. For some tasks this really is true, a lumber mill does what rough carpenters need hours to do in minutes, at a fraction the cost. Regardless actually build something isn't easy.

In fact it is so difficult, that here in the USA we've been getting worse at it.  Look at this chart of construction productivity over time:

All sectors except construction (Orange) have ballooned in productivity since the 50's. Agricultural productivity for example, has doubled 4 times! What about Construction? Well between 1947 and 2010 the annual growth rate was 0.1%. Further investigation yields something even more disparaging. For a while, construction producitvity kept pace with other sectors, even taking second place behind agriculture. After the Mid 60's however, this trend completely reversed itself, and within less than 50 years, the level of producivity in construction had more than halved! What happened?

What can't help is the lack of accountability almost inherent to the space. If a contractor fails at one of their designated tasks, they are incentivized to shed blame elsewhere. They couldn't get the order in because one of their suppliers was out of a neccesary material. One of their subcontractors failed to perform one of their deliverables. Et cetera et cetera. 

## The Blame Game

Software Engineering as a discipline is at risk of falling prey to the same disease: negligence. Negligence from higher ups is often branded as "delegating" -- putting responsibilities elsewhere, and the incredibly sinister "strategic reorganization" -- mass pre-emptive layoffs. While often the negligence I see from my peers takes the form of whining. Whining, as Theodore Roosevelt put it, is:

> Complaining without proposing a solution. e.g.
> JavaScript is worthless garbage.
> My Teacher/Boss/Lover/Parent hates me.
> My code won't work.

All of these sentences reflect a deep lack of personal accountability. Could it be the code *you* wrote is worthless? What might *you* have done to incur their ire? What can *you* do to fix it? 

What can *you* do to fix it, must have been one of the questions that the developers of TypeScript had asked themselves. If JS lacks needed type safety, what can I do? I am convinced that this question led to the developement of the TypeScript ecosystem. And if you Don't like it? Get a community together and work for a decade to build something else yourself. 

Don't blame your tools, help build new ones. More importantly though, you need to put in the time to become acquainted with your current tools. Becoming an expert at anything takes deliberate practice and focus.

Don't get me wrong, this practice might be painful and involve personal sacrifice, but if you do it every day, it'll get easier. But you have to do it every day.

Dodging accountability is something easy to do, and when an industry develops the habit, it never really goes away. The consequences for a construction worker might be an uneven gutter, but for scientist, engineers, and politicians the consequence is often the loss of and degredation of human lives.
