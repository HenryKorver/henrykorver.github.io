Here is the completed essay. I have incorporated your specific project details ("Rate My Tools," the ESLint struggle, etc.) and adopted a slightly more casual, repetitive style to drive the points home, as requested.

Reflect on Software Engineering
When I first started my ICS 314 class, I used the terms "software development" and "software engineering" interchangeably. After completing this class, the difference is notable. In part, the difference is the toolset. Software engineers use tools like Configuration Management and Agile Project Management, while better communicating using a set of Coding Standards and the language of Design Patterns. It isn't just about writing code; it's about the tools and the processes we use to manage that code.

One of the biggest things I learned about was Configuration Management. Basically, configuration management is the process of tracking and controlling changes to software. It’s like a history book for your code. If you don't have good configuration management, you lose track of what changes were made and who made them. For my final project, "Rate My Tools," we used GitHub to handle this. GitHub was built using configuration management principles to enable us to do the configuration management as easy as possible. Because we had projects on GitHub, we could track every version of "Rate My Tools." This concept goes way beyond just web apps. If you were writing a book with a team of writers, you would need a form of configuration management to make sure no one deletes someone else's chapter. You need that history and control, which is exactly what configuration management provides.

Another huge part of engineering is Agile Project Management. Agile is a way of managing projects by breaking them down into small, bite-sized pieces and doing them in short cycles. We specifically used a style called Issue Driven Project Management, where every task is an "issue." For "Rate My Tools," we used GitHub to enable us to do the Agile project management as easy as possible. We had "projects" inside GitHub that tracked our issues. It really helped us keep "Rate My Tools" organized. I could see myself using this for non-web projects, too. If I was planning a big event, like a wedding or a conference, I could use Agile Project Management. I would break the big event down into small "issues" and track them just like we did for "Rate My Tools." It’s just a really good way to get things done without getting overwhelmed.

Then there were Coding Standards. Coding standards are basically rules for how your code should look so that everyone on the team writes code the same way. In this class, we used a tool called ESLint to check our standards. Honestly, for "Rate My Tools," we initially had a bunch of ESLint errors. It was frustrating at first to see so many red lines. But we eventually learned to accept the specific formatting rules. By fixing the bunch of ESLint errors, our code for "Rate My Tools" became much easier to read. Even though the specific formatting rules were strict, accepting them meant our team could understand each other's work better.

Finally, we touched on Design Patterns. Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. They are like templates for solving issues. For "Rate My Tools," we didn't use design patterns in order to inform our development decisions directly, but it was cool to see them at play. Even though we didn't strictly use them to inform our development decisions directly, we understand they are useful. They give you a common language to talk about how to build things, which is super important in software engineering.

In conclusion, software engineering is a lot more than just development. It's about using Configuration Management to track work, Agile to manage tasks, and Coding Standards to keep things clean. Building "Rate My Tools" showed me that these tools—GitHub, ESLint, and Agile workflows—are what make the difference between a project that works and a project that fails.
