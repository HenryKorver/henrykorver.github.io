## On Questions and Dialogues
What a makes a question smart? What makes a question dumb?

To me a smart question is one that elicits intellectual curiosity in me and in others, and which has people that have a better grasp of the answer than I do. Under this definition, a question is dumb, if it. 
i. shuts down curiosity
ii. there is no one who has a better grasp of the question than I do

When is a question too smart for it's own good? 

In my mind, there are only two classes of overly "smart" questions.

The first group are ill-natured, performative displays of the authors erudition, meant to reinforce the author's ego as a smart and special individual, assuaging their insecurities and convincing them that they were not in fact stupid for needing to posit a question to another living breathing person. Of course, no one can know for certain that this was the intent of the author. This kind of question is wanton, lecherous, and decadent even. Often the author is nescient to the motive for their own behavior. One such chastize-worthy specimen is: https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/859253. This cow-eyed, slack-jawed specimen inquires about the connection between fiber optic supercontinuum generation and the 



The second group are a bit misinformed and confused. They may not make lots of sense most of the time. They type short sentences. They ask open ended questions. They under no pretenses, are an expert. Here is an example: 

I guess that, well, I'm not too interested in particular about whether a question is smart or dumb. I care more about whether or not it is a good question. Something that helps people.

One interesting thought of mine, that perhaps you will disagree with is that no question is good or bad in isolation, it is the context in which it is placed which makes it good or bad. The context is relevant, precisely because when someone asks something, another must answer, and at least how I see it, a good answer is one that seems to satisfy the questioner. 

Some might think that the converse of this statement is true, that a question is a good one if it satisfies the person answering. I'm not so sure. Certainly I think another thing that a question is.

My biggest concern would be that imposing a style guide on questions would hamper curiosity, and lead to less excitement around learning in general.

One final observation is that I noticed that a good question -- good answer pair has a balance of complexity. Neither the question nor answer outshines the other. 

That brings me to my final point. 

When is a question too smart for it's own good?

I actually think that there are way more types of overly smart answers than there are questions. The most prolific example is the analog of the "I'm so smart type questions." A typical exchange might go something like the following:

Q: What is that furry animal with hooves that runs around called again?
A: The answer to your question is probably donkey, zebra, horse, giraffe, cow, or any other ungulate that prances about. Of course that would be if and only if you meant what the animal was called in the english language as in spanish for example the same animals would be called burro, cebra, caballo, jirafa, y vaca. 

I like to conceptualize these as O(N^2) answers. That is, the answer fails to answer the question asked and does so in O(N^2) time where N was the amount of time spent posing the question. In this framework, an O(1) answer (which would likely answer the question albeit imperfectly) might look something like:

Q: What day of the week was it 1000 days ago?
A: Wednesday.

Because of these examples, I disagree with Eric Raymond on his overarching question asking philosophy. Good questions are made by good answers. Being explicit undercuts being concise, 
For me I would rather KISS than be explicit. Who cares what version of Ubuntu I'm running if the answer to my question would have been consistent for the LTS. And I place greater responsibility for weather or not a question was a good or bad one. on those answering the questions than those asking. 

That being said, his comments that "Choose your forum carefully" "Volume is not precision" "Describe the goal, not the step" are sage advice for anyone looking to get their question answered reliably on the internet. And "Don't Rush to Claim you have found a bug"All of these are second nature if you can learn to Keep it Simple Stupid.
